# CSS

I am using Codekit for compiling the SASS to CSS.

You won't need Codekit, you can just grab the compiled CSS file

## HTML files

I am using Codekit for it's .kit files.

These are basically like very simple PHP includes but for static HTML files.

You can either use the compiled HTML files or go into assets/ki-files/includes and grab the individual components from there.
